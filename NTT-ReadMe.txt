General:
This is an experimental mod, which does a number of changes to Nuclear Throne by Vlambeer,
most notably improving multiplayer aspects of the game, and adding online multiplayer support.
See "NTT-Changelog" file for the full list of changes and fixes as opposed to base game (update 98).


Installing:
1.	Right-click NT in your Steam library, pick Properties - Local Files - Browse local files.
2.	Extract the NTT archive into the Nuclear Throne directory.
3.	Run "NTT-Assemble" executable to assemble a new NT executable from data.win and .part files.
If all's well, your original Nuclear Throne executable will be backed up
(as "nuclearhrone-(datetime)"), and NTT executable will take it's place.

If everything was done correctly, the game will display a mod notice in the menu.


Uninstalling:
Rename the mod-provided NuclearThrone executable to something else, and rename the original back.
Or "verify cache" for the game, which will restore any files affected by the mod.


Additional controls:
The following controls are specific to this particular mod:
T	Open chat (when in-game or in lobby). Also see "Chat commands" section below.
Tab	Display statistic overlay (contains FPS, network latency, and network latency graph).
You can also use the "weapon swap" keybind in coop character selection screen to change the between
the visual variants ("skins") on the selected character.
